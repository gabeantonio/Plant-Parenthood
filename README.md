# Plant-Parenthood

## About 

Welcome to Plant Parenthood! By now you're probably either a plant parent or looking to be one. We've got you covered! 

Plant Parenthood is a web-based plant care application that allows you to:

1. Create a file for your plant(s).
2. Give your plant a name other than its common or scientific name. 
3. Add a photo of your own choosing for your plant's file. 
4. Keep track of and set watering schedules. 
5. Add which fertilizer you'd like to use on your plant. 
6. Delete a plant's file - in case...you just so happen to kill it. (But you won't need to worry about that from now on.)

## Application Walkthrough

Upon opening the application, you'll come across the home page:

Create your account, while making sure to adhere to the Username and Password critera. When you're ready, you can click "Sign Up"!

Congratulations! You're one step closer to not killing your plant. If you want to learn more about the team who got this application up and running, you can click the "About" button on the navigation bar, and it'll take you to the page below:

Now, you'll notice there are other links in the Navigation Bar. One says "Log Out" (We'll let you guess what that one does) and the other two are dropdown links named "Plants" and "Supplementals". 

Clicking the "Plants" dropdown will show you two links, named: "My Plants" and "Add a Plant", like so:

When you click the "My Plants" link, you'll be redirected to a page that displays all of your current plants that you have. If you have not added any yet, the page will let you know that you don't have any plants yet. See below:

When you click the "Add A Plant" Link, you'll be redirected to a form that looks like this: 

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/zMmueuS.png)

On this page, you can go ahead and fill in the information about the new plant you want to add. Then, simply click the "Add Your Plant!" button.

Now that you've added a plant, it should now be rendered on your My Plants page, as a part of your ever-growing plant family. Hooray!

You can click on each of your plants, and you'll then be taken to the plant's details page, that lists information about the plant. An example detail page would look something like this:

This page is where you can keep track of your watering schedule. You can input the date of your watering, and by clicking "Add Watering", the date that you watered your plant will now render on your plant's personal page, for you to look back at and keep track of! How nice!

On this page, you can add a photo of you beautiful plant by clicking the "Choose File" button, selecting the picture you'd like, and then clicking the "Upload Photo" button! After doing so, your page now has a picture of your plant!

Lastly, you can also add a specific fertilizer that you'd like to pair with your plant. If you already added some fertilizers that you use, you'll see them displayed at the bottom of the page. You can click "Add" to add it to your plant's profile, or "Remove" to remove it, in the case that you plan on switching out fertilizers. 

You can add or edit your list of Fertilizers by scrolling to the top of the page and clicking the "Supplementals" dropdown menu. You'll find two links: "View Fertilizers" and "Add Fertilizer".

Clicking the "View Fertilizers" link will redirect you to the page below, which will show all the fertilizers you have in your arsenal:

Clicking the "Add Fertilizer" link will take you to this page:

Go ahead and fill the form out to add your new fertilizer, then click the "Submit" button! Ta-da! You can now view it in your "View Fertilizers" page.
